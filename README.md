## AI Algorithm Details

### Core Strategy
The AI uses a multi-layered approach:

1. **First Guess**: Always uses a proven optimal starter word from a curated list
2. **Subsequent Guesses**: Uses entropy-based decision making to maximize information gain
3. **Word Filtering**: Advanced logic for handling repeated letters and position constraints
4. **Scoring System**: Multi-factor scoring including letter frequency, position frequency, and pattern recognition

### Key Components

#### AdvancedWordleAI
- Base AI class with information theory implementation
- Entropy calculations for optimal guess selection
- Advanced word filtering with repeated letter handling
- Fixed starter word list for consistent first guesses

#### OptimizedWordleAI
- Enhanced version with additional heuristics
- Letter combination analysis
- Repeated letter pattern recognition
- Improved scoring algorithms
- Better handling of edge cases

### Performance Metrics
- **Average Attempts**: Typically 3-4 attempts for most words
- **Win Rate**: >95% success rate on standard Wordle words
- **Handles Edge Cases**: Effectively solves words with repeated letters like "eerie", "seeds"
- **Consistent Performance**: Uses proven starter words for reliable first guesses

## Examples

### CLI Example
```
Testing solution: RAISE
  Attempt 1: RAISE | Using starter word: RAISE | Eliminates from 2309 possible words
  Feedback: GGGGG
  âœ… SOLVED in 1 attempts!

Testing solution: EERIE
  Attempt 1: RAISE | Using starter word: RAISE | Eliminates from 2309 possible words
  Feedback: GYBBG
  Attempt 2: ERODE | Only 2 possible words remaining | Eliminates from 2 possible words
  Feedback: GYBBG
  Attempt 3: EERIE | Only 1 possible words remaining | Eliminates from 1 possible words
  Feedback: GGGGG
  âœ… SOLVED in 3 attempts!
```

### GUI Example
The GUI provides a visual game board where you can:
- Make manual guesses with real-time feedback
- See AI suggestions with detailed reasoning
- View AI information and statistics
- Test different scenarios with manual feedback
- Watch AI solve games automatically

### Web Bot Example
The web bot can automatically:
- Open the official Wordle website

## Customization

### Modifying Starter Words
Edit the `starter_words` list in `advanced_wordle_ai.py`:
```python
self.starter_words = ['raise', 'stare', 'crane', 'slate', 'audio', ...]
```

### Adding New Words
Add words to `wordle_words.txt` (one word per line, lowercase).

### Adjusting AI Parameters
Modify scoring weights and thresholds in the AI classes for different strategies.

### Web Bot Settings
- Change `headless=False` to `True` for background operation
- Adjust `time.sleep()` values for different game speeds
- Modify browser options for different environments

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing wordle_words.txt**
   - Ensure the file is in the same directory as the Python scripts
   - Check file permissions

2. **Web Bot Issues**
   - Ensure Chrome browser is installed
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify selenium and webdriver-manager are installed
   - Try running in non-headless mode first

3. **GUI Not Starting**
   - Ensure tkinter is available (usually included with Python)
   - Check for missing dependencies

4. **AI Performance Issues**
   - Verify word list is complete and properly formatted
   - Check that all AI files are present

### Performance Tips

1. **For Large-Scale Testing**: Use the CLI version for faster processing
2. **For Interactive Testing**: Use the GUI for step-by-step analysis
3. **For Real Game Play**: Use the web bot for automated play
4. **For Development**: Use the game simulator for algorithm testing
